This code was used for the behavioural profiling pipeline outlined in "Behavioural profiling of autism connectivity abnormalities" 
(DOI: https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2019.102)
Note that the code refers to steps after inputing ROIs to the Sleuth software
The code is used to sample from the Sleuth text files and generate new text files
The new text files are subjected to GingerALE meta-analysis (FWE cluster corrected at p<0.05)
The GingerALE nifti files, per ROI,  are input to the othe .m files here to achieve smoothened proportions
